# Beijing-Air-Quality-Machine-Learning-Project-
Used machine learning techniques in order to analyze the air quality in the city of Beijing, China . Looked for various factors that could contribute to the air pollutants that are prevalent as well as did an analysis on the different machine learning algorithms to look at which ones would be the most effective.
